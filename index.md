        <div class="text"><p>Soft materials are characterized by their ability to easily deform at room
            temperature by thermal forces, or in response to external stimuli. These materials are
            ubiquitous in the biological world (DNA, cells, proteins), have numerous industrial
            applications, and are integral to the development of two emerging fields: biomimetic systems
            and soft (flexible) electronics. The aim of our research group is to explore the shape,
            assembly, and flow of soft materials at the nanoscale. We strive to provide an accurate
            reconstruction of material behavior in practical applications by developing and rigorously
            investigating minimal yet realistic models of soft materials such as biomimetic membranes,
            polymeric nanoparticles, self-assembled colloids, and glassy liquids. Investigations are
            carried out using both theory and simulation methods such as molecular dynamics and
            employing advanced cyberinfrastructure capabilities including high-performance computing
            resources and science gateways. We anticipate our research to advance the experimental
            design principles that tailor tunable features in soft-materials based nanoscale devices for
            applications in drug delivery, energy devices, and stretchable electronics. At the same
            time, we expect these studies to identify the fundamental microscopic mechanisms that give
            rise to the observed macroscopic behavior of these advanced materials.</p></div>
